On time / In time 

On time = at the planned time; neither late nor early
> Please make sure that your essays are completed on time.

In time = with enough time to spare; before the last moment
> I'm glad you made it in time.


She will take you along, if you promise to behave.
If I do (probable) 
This type of sentence implies that the if-action is quite probable.
If + Simple Present, something will happen 
> If I study, I will pass the exam.


Seem (not in continuous) 
Seem is not used in the continuous tenses (-ing)
> He seems to be having difficulty breathing.
> What do you think? That seems about right to me.
> She seemed very friendly when we first met her, but later she turned out to be vicious.

Hardly/Scarcely/Barely (Inversion of the verb) 

When Hardly, scarcely or barely appears at the beginning of the sentence, the verb is inverted (like in questions). The second part of the sentence usually hasbefore or than in it. The action is generally past.
> Hardly had Cinderella made the wish than her wish appeared. (NOT: Cinderella had)
> Scarcely had I put down the phone before it rang again.
> Barely had the thief climbed out the window before the owner entered the room.

Hardly ever 
We use hardly ever or scarcely ever to mean almost never.
> The Chinese peasant had hardly ever tasted wine.
> She had scarcely ever seen a criminal, let alone met a murderer.
If we use Hardly ever at the beginning of a sentence, it inverts as in the rule above.
