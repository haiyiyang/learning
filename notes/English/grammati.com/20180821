If I did (unreal situation) 

When the if-clause refers to a situation which is unreal or not expected
we use: If +Simple Past (did) + something would/could/might happen
> If I won a million dollars, I would buy a boat.



I suggested she take him to the hospital to get X-rayed.

Subjunctive (be) 
We use be instead of was or were after someone suggests or demands (or requests, requires, insists, orders, recommends) that something be done.
> I demanded that I be excused. (not: was excused)

This rule applies to all verbs, not just be. They all have to be in a subjunctive form (I be, we do, you go).
> She recommended we try the duck.
> He insisted we give him another chance.
> I suggested he rewrite it and submit it again.



I've never heard from / about / of such a thing before.

> I heard about the accident.

Hear of is used when we learn of the existence of someone or something
> I have heard of Sharon Wallace and I would like to meet her.

Hear from means to receive a message from someone
> I want to hear from you every now and then.
