Reported Speech Past Tense Reporting 
When we report a conversation to another person, the verb in the reported statement has to agree with the tense of the reporting verb. There are essentially 2 ways of reporting.

Past Tense Reporting: If we use the past tense to report what was said, all the tenses in the speech have to go back one tense.
> "I'll fix it," Jacob said. Jacob said he would fix it.
> "We've finished that job now," said Charlie. Charlie said they had finished that job.

Changes:
> Present > Past
> Past > Past Perfect
> Present Perfect > Past Perfect
> Will > Would
> Can > Could

Present Tense Reporting: If we use the present tense to report what was said, we do not change the verbs in the speech.
> "I'm coming tomorrow." said Dave. Dave says he is coming tomorrow.
> "We've finished that job now," said Charlie. Charlie says they have finished that job now.
