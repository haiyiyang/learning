On time / In time 

On time = at the planned time; neither late nor early
> Please make sure that your essays are completed on time.

In time = with enough time to spare; before the last moment
> I'm glad you made it in time.


She will take you along, if you promise to behave.
If I do (probable) 
This type of sentence implies that the if-action is quite probable.
If + Simple Present, something will happen 
> If I study, I will pass the exam.


Seem (not in continuous) 
Seem is not used in the continuous tenses (-ing)
> He seems to be having difficulty breathing.
> What do you think? That seems about right to me.
> She seemed very friendly when we first met her, but later she turned out to be vicious.

Hardly/Scarcely/Barely (Inversion of the verb) 

When Hardly, scarcely or barely appears at the beginning of the sentence, the verb is inverted (like in questions). The second part of the sentence usually hasbefore or than in it. The action is generally past.
> Hardly had Cinderella made the wish than her wish appeared. (NOT: Cinderella had)
> Scarcely had I put down the phone before it rang again.
> Barely had the thief climbed out the window before the owner entered the room.

Hardly ever 
We use hardly ever or scarcely ever to mean almost never.
> The Chinese peasant had hardly ever tasted wine.
> She had scarcely ever seen a criminal, let alone met a murderer.
If we use Hardly ever at the beginning of a sentence, it inverts as in the rule above.


Word order (place)

Usually the verb (do) and the place go together, if there is no adverb. If there is, it usually goes between the verb and the place.
> Go home. 
> Go directly home.

If the verb has an object, it comes before the place
> Take her home.
> Take her directly home.


Catch up / Keep up 

Catch up = to move fast enough to become equal with another.
> He finally caught up with his brother in height.

Keep up = continue at the same pace or level.
> The snow kept up all day.

Past Perfect 
The Past Perfect (had + ...ed) is used to refer back to an action that occurred before the sequence of actions you are talking about in the past. 
It is only used when you are telling a story in the past and you need to look back from a point in the past to another point even further back in the past.
> I rushed out of the house and headed for my car. When I got there, I realised I had left my keys in the house.
> It was several hours before Mr Jones realised he had mistaken Mrs Smith for Mrs White.

Last time I saw you you were working at that firm.
Past continuous (happened before) 
The Past continuous can be used to talk about an activity that was going on when another action took place.
> Tom was talking (Past Continuous) on the phone when I arrived (Simple Past).
> I was watching TV when the earthquake happened.
> She was taking a shower when the phone rang.
> They were driving along quite peacefully when a cat shot out in front of them.
